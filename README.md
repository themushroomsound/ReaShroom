# ReaShroom
A collection of Reaper scripts

## 1. RemoveStemTracksPrefixes

Removes a common prefix from the names of selected tracks. When you import music stems you often get a number of tracks with names like "MyAwesomeTune_Drums", "MyAwesomeTune_Bass", "MyAwesomeTune_Vocals", etc. You know your tune is awesome, so all you really want to see as tracks names is "Drums", "Bass", "Vocals", etc. That's what this script does.

*How to use it*

Simply select the tracks you want the script to operate on and execute it.

## 2. RepeatRandomizedItems

Generates evenly spaced items chosen randomly from a set of selected items on the same track. This is useful for laying down footstep SFXs on a walking/running animation (if the walking/running is regular). The items sequence is randomized in a way that prevents the same item from being repeated twice in a row.

*How to use it*

1. Place the source items on a track
2. Measure the time between 2 footsteps in your animation cycle
3. Select the time range on which to lay the footsteps
4. Select your source items
5. Execute this script
6. When prompted, enter the time you measured

Enjoy
